Welcome to Armeria
==================
*Armeria* is an asynchronous RPC/API client/server library built on top of `Java 8`_, `Netty 4.1`_, `HTTP/2`_,
and `Thrift`_. It is open-sourced and licensed under `Apache License 2.0`_ by `LINE Corporation`_, who uses
it in production.

Is your RPC really async?
-------------------------
Yes, Armeria is.

- Asynchronous connection pool ensures your application never blocks even on pool exhaustion.
- Domain name lookups are also fully asynchronous thanks to Netty's asynchronous domain name resolver.
- No head-of-line blocking problem thanks to HTTP/2 support

Compatibility with existing Thrift implementations
--------------------------------------------------
- Works with `THttpClient`_, the official Thrift-over-HTTP client
- Works with the code generated by the official Thrift IDL compiler
- Automatically upgrades to HTTP/2 when used with the Armeria client
